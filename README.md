# CandleProject

MY THOUGHT PROCESS:

1. I originally made 3 seperate java class files for each candle with their respective information and use the main java file to print all 3 of the candle's information.
2. I scrapped that idea and used some a lot of the knowledge about JavaScript and some of the things I've learned about Java thus far to create 3 instances that print out the same kind of information for each candle.
3. It took me a while to figure out how to get the formula (dollar per burn time) as a property but in the end, I just made the forumula within the "system.out.println".
4. The 3 candle files I have in my "src" folder were my attempts at getting this project to run.
   

HOW DOES THIS WORK?

1. I created 3 instances for my candles that give you the properties of the title, amount, price, burn time, and dollar per burn time.
2. I used the "this" keyword to retrieve information from the properties mentioned.
3. I labeled every variable below "get" with the variable name to tell me that this is getting the information from the properties.
4. I then created 3 seperate instances that contain all the unique properties mentioned above.
5. I then print out all the information above to the console plus the formula that gets the "dollar per burn time" by dividing the "price" property and the "burn time" property.
